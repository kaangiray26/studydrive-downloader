Using webRequests to intercept and download files from Studydrive

## About
This project is a simple demonstration of how to intercept and download files from Studydrive using webRequests API in a Firefox extension. On any document page of Studydrive, the extension will create a button that will download the file. The file will be downloaded to the default download location of the browser.
